# DeckEncoder

[![Build and Test](https://github.com/maichmueller/DeckEncoder/actions/workflows/gtest.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/maichmueller/DeckEncoder/actions/workflows/gtest.yml)

Port of [LoRDeckCodes](https://github.com/RiotGames/LoRDeckCodes) from C# to C++17. Not many (if any) optimizations have been made to the code and thus is kept true to the source mainly.
Only requires GoogleTest to run the tests. Otherwise, no dependencies are needed.
